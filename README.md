# Over-Sand-Vehicle
An Introduction to Engineering Design Project

This project is the culmination of a semester-long group effort in a University of Maryland ENES100 course.
The end-product was a fully functional, autonomous, Over-Sand Vehicle that was capable of navigating to a pool of water and measuring the pool's depth. Members of this team designed and implemented this OSV using the Arduino microcontroller, the Arduino IDE, RF Communications, and Autodesk Inventor (for 3D-printed parts)

The ENES100code file contains the final master code executed by the OSV. I, along with 3 other groupmates are the authors of this code.
The OSV Navigation Map is a visual aide to understand the hierarchy of the code's instructions for OSV navigation.
The Final Design Report is a detailed summary of this group's work throughout the semester, as well as a reflection on the project. All 8 group members contributed to this Report.
